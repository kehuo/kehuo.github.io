# CMU 15445 Database System Overview


This is a learning note for the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://db.cs.cmu.edu) course: [Introduction to Database Systems](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu) (15-445). 

This course is on the design and implementation of database management systems. Topics include data models (relational, document, key/value), storage models (n-ary, decomposition), query languages (SQL, stored procedures), storage architectures (heaps, log-structured), indexing (order preserving trees, hash tables), transaction processing (ACID, concurrency control), recovery (logging, checkpoints), query processing (joins, sorting, aggregation, optimization), and parallel architectures (multi-core, distributed). Case studies on open-source and commercial database systems are used to illustrate these techniques and trade-offs. The course is appropriate for students that are prepared to flex their strong systems programming skills.

This course also has a lab posted by CMU at [Github]. The lab is to build a relational database management system called BusTub. CMU provides an Github repository for this lab.

I have forked this [lab repo](https://github.com/kehuo/bustub) and will complete it after finishing learning the course.

Also, the textbook used for this course is 
[**Database System Concepts**](https://www.db-book.com/).
