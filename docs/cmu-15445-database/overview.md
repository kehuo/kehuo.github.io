# CMU 15445 Database System Overview


This is a learning note for the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://db.cs.cmu.edu) course: [Introduction to Database Systems](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu) (15-445). 

This course also has a lab posted by CMU at [Github]. The lab is to build a relational database management system called BusTub. CMU provides an Github repository for this lab.

I have forked this [lab repo](https://github.com/kehuo/bustub) and will complete it after finishing learning the course.

Also, the textbook used for this course is 
**Database System Concepts**.
