# CMU 15445 Database System


This is a learning note for the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://db.cs.cmu.edu) [Introduction to Database Systems](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu) (15-445/645) course. 

There is also a lab for this course. The lab is to build a relational database management system called BusTub. CMU provides an Github repository for this lab, I have forked this lab repo and will complete this [lab](https://github.com/kehuo/bustub) after finishing learning the course.
